# t_string
A super cool string struct :)

Just for me not to forget, the t_string wil be more safe if I instead of pointing to NULL when I don't have any content on the buffer, make it empty, it means lenght 0, its safer, at least thats how cpp implemented their string struct and also I like it. However, in some cases, for example when i have a 0 lenght str, it would cause me some trouble, honestly, rn idk what to do, but I'll find out, I hope, kkkkkkkkkkkk
